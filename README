FruitChecker v0.01 README

FruitChecker is a filecollection-comparison tool for linux/cygwin, and it
takes CSV files created by PICCHECK/The!Checker.
While PICCHECK is nice for users with MS Windows, this software is intended
for cygwin and linux users.


Installation & upgrade

  - Installation using command-lines and wget
       wget https://github.com/bitterfruit/fruitchecker/master.zip
       unzip master.zip && rm -v master.zip
       cd fruitchecker-master/
       sudo ./install.sh
         (drop the sudo on Cygwin)

    or

  - Click the "Download ZIP" button on GitHub to download FruitChecker.
       https://github.com/bitterfruit/fruitchecker

  Ubuntu:
    - Extract the zip file and run the install script:
         sudo ./install.sh
    - The script should now ask you yes or no on packages to install.
      These packages are required. Answering no will abort the script:
         packages: TBD

  Cygwin:
    - Extract the zip file and run the install script:
         ./install.sh
    - The script will tell you what packages you are missing, if any.
      With Cygwin's Setup-x86.exe you will need to get the following packages:
         Packages: perl, perl-tk, xinit, p7zip. Optional: perl-Win32-GUI

    - You will also need to install WinRAR from rarlab.com if you haven't
      got it. WinRAR from rarlab.com is not 100% compatible with Cygwin.
      Known problems with WinRAR and Cygwin: RAR archives with doublequotes used
      in passwords.


Uninstallation (Cygwwin & ubuntu):

    Run the uninstall.sh script. Use sudo on ubuntu.
